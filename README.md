a handover date of April 27, 2024, and is designed to be responsive across various browsers and operating systems. The system's performance 
is optimized for quick response times and can handle a maximum of 100,000 users and 80,000 books. The documentation includes this SRS as a 
comprehensive guide for developers, users, and maintenance teams.
